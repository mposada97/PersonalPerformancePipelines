# PersonalPerformancePipelines

The idea of this project was to build data pipelines around my personal data. The first step was this diagram which I used to decide which aspects of my life I am interested in tracking and which have readily available data that I can consume trhough API's.

After completing the diagram I decided to leverage IoT techonlogy with my Oura ring to get my health data that includes readiness, sleep, resilience and heart rate. I also decided to buuild a pipeline around my newest hobbie, which is chess, I have been playing games in chess.com, they have a public API that I can consume to get my games.
